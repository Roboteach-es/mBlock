# mBlockRT (mBlock 3.5.0)

**mBlockRT** (a.k.a. mBlock Roboteach) is a fork of the [mBlock IDE from Makeblock](https://github.com/Roboteach-es/mBlockRT/tree/V3.4.5), created to solve some problems found in the original software. It was forked from the last published source code of the 3.x family (v3.4.5), although MakeBlock released later some additional revisions (up to v3.4.12) that never made their way into the (public) repository.

## Open Source

This fork also is created to preserve the open source common wealth, as the company, Makeblock, has created a new version (family v5.x) that is privative, cutting all kind of support to the original project and its users base.

## How to install

Soon...
